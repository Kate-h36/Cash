# Cash Problem

## Cash Problem using Greedy Algorithm in C

This is a C program that solves the cash problem using the greedy algorithm. Given a cash amount and a set of coin denominations, the program determines the minimum number of coins needed to make the change.
For instance, if some customer is owed 41¢, the biggest first (i.e., best immediate, or local) bite that can be taken is 25¢. (That bite is “best” inasmuch as it gets closer to 0¢ faster than any other coin would.)
